WorldLink is a conceptual Minecraft mod that allows players to connect their single-player or multiplayer worlds using craftable portals, without any central server. Each world is treated as a "star" in a shared universe.

Key features include:
- Peer-to-peer portal linking system
- Player-controlled access and permissions
- Integration with Mojang licenses for secure identity
- Strict mod compatibility checking
- Fully serverless architecture
